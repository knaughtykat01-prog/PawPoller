# PawPoller Session Handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-06-27
**Current version:** 2.30.0 — **Personas** (per-account views + per-persona digests across all 11
platforms). **Released + deployed** on 2026-06-27 (commit `3375db5`, tag `v2.30.0`; CI published all
three desktop assets; GCP VM `/api/health` reports `2.30.0`, clean startup, personas migration ran
idempotently). Full suite green (158 passed). Builds on the 2.29.0 redesign shell. **Follow-up:**
desktop `.exe` ships via CI (done); the publish-check "post as account" selector + growth-rate/
watcher-count scoping + a per-persona Telegram chat override remain deferred.

**2.30.0 personas (this session)** — the identity layer on top of the existing multi-account data
model. Four parts, all account-aware via the new `database/scope.py` `account_clause`. CHANGELOG [2.30.0].
- **Personas** (`database/personas.py` NEW): `personas` table + nullable `accounts.persona_id`
  (NULL = Unassigned; soft ref, no FK). CRUD + `assign_account_persona` + `list_accounts_by_persona`
  + `persona_stats` (sums `account_stats`). Synced via `_personas_manifest` (applied before accounts).
  API under `/api/personas` + `POST /api/accounts/{id}/persona`. Accounts page: Personas card +
  per-row persona `<select>`.
- **Per-account scoping** (`scope.py` + 11 `*_queries.py`/`*_api.py`): `get_*_summary` /
  `_submissions` / `_aggregate_snapshots` take optional `account_id` (None ⇒ All accounts, identical
  to before); endpoints gain `account_id` Query param. Context-bar **account selector** (`app.js`
  `_populateAccountSwitch`) appears when a platform has 2+ enabled accounts; threads `_acctId(code)`
  into dashboard/submissions/compare. Growth-rates + watcher counts stay aggregate (follow-up).
- **Per-persona notifications** (`polling/telegram.py`): digests (regular + weekly) emit **one
  message per persona** + Unassigned (per-account breakdown + combined totals); no-personas installs
  get the original single digest. Consolidated poll summary groups by persona. `check_milestones_batch`
  scoped by `account_id` (labels + fixes a multi-account double-fire). Instant alerts lead with a
  persona/account line (IB/FA explicit; 9 others via a `current_alert_account` ContextVar set in
  `server.py`). All labelling suppressed on single-unassigned-account installs.
- **Persona overview** (`accounts.js`, `app.js`): `#/persona/:id` — combined stat cards +
  per-platform breakdown + member accounts (each "View →" deep-links to the platform dashboard
  pre-scoped to the account).
- **Follow-ups:** desktop `.exe` not rebuilt (same as 2.29.0); growth-rate/watcher-count scoping +
  a per-persona Telegram chat override + a cross-platform combined time-series are deferred.

**2.29.0 redesign (prior session)** — a ground-up redesign of the dashboard **shell + navigation +
Home**, on the shared frontend (desktop + server), reusing the ~50 existing page-render functions
(only the chrome and the Overview changed). CHANGELOG [2.29.0].
- **Shell** (`index.html`, `css/layout.css`, `app.js` `init()`+`route()`): persistent **labeled
  sidebar** (collapse/pin, persisted to `localStorage`) + a **context bar** (clickable breadcrumb +
  platform switcher + Dashboard/Submissions/Compare sub-tabs, IB's un-prefixed routes special-cased)
  + surfaced ⌘K search + a responsive drawer / floating bottom tab bar on mobile. New type
  (**Bricolage Grotesque** + **Hanken Grotesk**) and vivid per-platform **colour tiles**; all 8
  token themes intact.
- **Platforms hub** (`#/platforms`, `renderPlatformsHub()`) replaces the modal popover — colour
  tiles + live status dots (reuses `platform_health` via `#pg-status-{code}`).
- **Configurable Home dashboard**: `renderOverview()` rewritten to a **widget grid** with a
  **customize mode** (add/remove/resize/drag); layout **server-saved** via the new additive
  `dashboard_layout` preference (`routes/api.py` get+save → `settings.json`).
- New files: `frontend/js/platforms.js` (canonical 11-platform registry + route helpers, replaces a
  5-way duplicated list) and `frontend/css/redesign.css` (hub tiles + dashboard widgets + header
  accent). Platform-detail headers pick up the brand colour via `route()` + CSS (no per-platform edits).
- **Legacy ⇄ Beta switch**: `dashboard.py` `serve_index` serves the new (`beta`) or the frozen
  pre-redesign (`legacy`) shell per `?ui=` (cookie-persisted `pp_ui`); a small fixed switch is
  injected into both. Legacy = `index_legacy.html` + `tokens_legacy.css`/`layout_legacy.css`/
  `app_legacy.js` (git-HEAD snapshots). Default `beta` (`_DEFAULT_UI`); flip to `legacy` for a
  zero-surprise rollout + one-click fallback.
- **Verified live** via Chrome DevTools on a local `uvicorn dashboard:app`: no JS console errors;
  desktop + mobile shell, the hub, and the configurable dashboard (incl. the **server-save
  round-trip**) all render. `node --check` on touched JS + `py_compile` on `routes/api.py` pass.
- **Staged follow-up**: editor / settings / posting / platform-detail tables keep working and get
  the full bold restyle later. Before deploy, regenerate any cached `*_SoFurry.html` per the note
  below if stories were touched.

### 2.28.x (deployed) — SoFurry beta migration + FurAffinity direct-scraper
The 2.28.x line completed the **SoFurry "beta" migration** (2.28.0 posting rebuild + 2.28.1
discovery fix) and the **FurAffinity direct-scraper** work: 2.28.2 refreshed the stale FA
submission parser (FA's HTML moved to `submission-page-stats` / `data-tag-name` / twitter-meta
rating) and wired the direct FA client through the CF Worker proxy so it can run on the **server**.
**2.28.0–2.28.3 are released + deployed** (`/api/health` reports `2.28.3`). **2.28.3** fixed a bug
2.28.2 introduced: its ReDoS mitigation bounded the stats regex whitespace too tightly (`\s{0,30}`)
and matched nothing on FA's deep indentation; the correct fix de-overlaps the quantifiers instead.
CHANGELOG [2.28.3].

**Server FA state — DONE 2026-06-24:** 2.28.3 deployed; FA `a`/`b` cookies in the
encrypted vault; `fa_use_cf_proxy=true` + `fa_direct_polling=true` — the server now
**direct-scrapes FA stats through the CF proxy** (verified live: views 324/364/203…),
off the flaky FAExport. 77 corrupt zero-snapshots cleaned. **Caveat:** under
`fa_direct_polling` the watcher/comment paths still go via FAExport (so they're paused
while it's down) — porting direct watchers (`/watchlist/by/{user}/` scrapes fine) +
comments off the `/view/` page is the remaining follow-up. Full SF API map:
`docs/reference/sofurry_beta_api_map.md`.

**Heads-up:** existing stories' `*_SoFurry.html` use the OLD class-based markup —
**re-generate** them so the SF converter emits the new TipTap HTML before re-uploading,
or the new render won't apply. FA direct polling must run from the **desktop** instance
(datacenter IP is Cloudflare-blocked). See "Multi-account model" below before touching
accounts / credentials / pollers / posting.

**Historical zero-snapshot cleanup — DONE 2026-06-23.** After deploying 2.27.2, the
one-off cleanup ran against prod: **746 corrupt `views=0` rows deleted** (ao3 25, sqw 270,
fa 451), each one provably bad (every zero belonged to a work that also had a non-zero
snapshot; cumulative counts never decrease). 0 remain. DB backed up first to
`/app/data/pawpoller.db.bak.1782177890`. Past charts and the 7-day weekly-digest baseline
are now clean; the 2.27.1 guards stop new ones forming.

## Multi-account (in progress) — multiple accounts per platform

**Goal:** run more than one account per platform (e.g. two FurAffinity accounts), all active
at once, for both polling and posting. Plan file:
`~/.claude/plans/stateless-nibbling-newell.md`. Pilot = Inkbunny + FurAffinity first, then
roll out the other 9. Same-platform accounts poll **sequentially** (per-IP rate limits).

**End-to-end status:** multi-account **polling works for ALL 11 platforms** on the server —
the orchestrator enumerates each platform's enabled accounts (sequential within a platform,
concurrent across platforms). Add a 2nd account on the Accounts page and it gets polled on
the next cycle with its own credentials, session, and segregated data. **Posting** "post as
account" is fully wired for IB + FA; the other posters still need the per-account
`_ensure_client` treatment (see remaining list).

**Landed so far (Phase 0 + IB + FA + WS verticals + orchestrator + posting + cross-cutting):**
- **`accounts` table** (`database/accounts.py`) — global surrogate `account_id`, one
  `is_default` account per platform (partial unique index). Seeded in `database/db.py`
  `_run_migrations` (Migration 0) for every platform that has credentials.
- **Credential model** (`config.py`): default account keeps the legacy flat keys
  (`username`, `fa_cookie_a`…); extra accounts use `acct_<id>_<field>` keys. Resolver
  `get_account_credentials` / `resolve_account_credentials`; vault routing via
  `is_credential_key` (catches namespaced secrets). **Zero credential migration** for
  existing installs.
- **Schema migrations** (`database/db.py`): additive `account_id` on IB
  submissions/snapshots/comments/poll_log/faving_users + posting_queue/posting_log
  (backfilled to the platform's default account — NOT literally id 1); constraint rebuilds
  in `_run_table_rebuilds()` on an FK-off connection: `session_cache` singleton →
  PK `account_id`, `watchers` → `UNIQUE(account_id, username)`, `publications` →
  `UNIQUE(story_name, chapter_index, platform, account_id)`.
- **IB queries** (`database/queries.py`): session/snapshot/submission/faving/watcher/
  poll_log writes all take `account_id`.
- **IB poller** (`polling/poller.py`): `run_poll_cycle(account_id=None, …)` — per-account
  creds + session; first-poll suppression is per-account; `account_id=None` ⇒ default account.
- **IB posting**: `posting_queries.upsert_publication` / `get_publication_by_story` are
  account-aware (default → platform default); IB poster `_ensure_client` reads
  `session_cache WHERE account_id = ?` (the old `id=1` shared-token read is GONE).
- **FurAffinity vertical** — additive `account_id` on `fa_submissions`/`fa_snapshots`/
  `fa_comments`/`fa_poll_log`/`fa_profile_stats`; `fa_watchers` rebuilt to
  `UNIQUE(account_id, username)` preserving spam columns; `fa_queries.py` (incl. the
  watcher spam-confirmation flow) and `fa_poller.py` are account-scoped;
  `send_fa_watcher_digest` iterates accounts.
- **Orchestrator** (`server.py` `_poll_all`) — enumerates enabled accounts for
  account-aware platforms (`ib`, `fa`), polling a platform's accounts sequentially and
  platforms concurrently; per-account creds gate via `accounts.DEFAULT_CRED_CHECKS`.
- **Account CRUD API** (`routes/accounts` in `routes/settings_api.py`) + Accounts page
  (`frontend/js/accounts.js`, nav + `#/accounts` route). Sync carries an `_accounts_manifest`.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_accounts.py`, `tests/test_migration_multiaccount.py` (legacy→multi
  upgrade for IB **and** FA, all green — 121 passed).

- **Posting "post as account"** — account-aware end to end (HTTP →
  manager → posters → scheduler → queue → DB). `POST /api/posting/post` takes
  `account_ids: {platform: id}`, `/api/posting/update` takes `account_id`;
  `manager._get_poster` is keyed `(platform, account_id)`; IB+FA posters
  authenticate per account; `update_story` updates each pub as its own account;
  the scheduler/desktop-auto-queue carry `account_id`.

- **Per-account stats** on the Accounts page (each account's subs/views/faves/
  comments side by side, via `accounts.account_stats` + `GET /api/accounts`).
- **Telegram** consolidated summary labels accounts when a platform has >1.
- **Drift** (`posting/sync.py`) change records carry `account_id`.

**Remaining:**
1. **Posting "post as account" for the other posters** — IB + FA posters
   authenticate per account in `_ensure_client`; the rest (`ws`, `sf`, `sqw`,
   `ao3`, `da`, `bsky`, `ik` posters) still read flat creds, so they post as the
   default account regardless of the selected account. Give each the same
   treatment the IB/FA posters got (read `config.resolve_account_credentials`
   + per-account session/cookies). The posting *data layer*
   (`posting_queries`/manager/scheduler) is already account-aware.
2. **Frontend "post as" selector** — the publish-check matrix
   (`frontend/js/publish_check.js`) should let you pick which account to post as
   and pass `account_ids` to `/api/posting/post`. Backend is ready.
3. **Deeper dashboard integration** — an account picker on the main per-submission
   charts/tables in `app.js` (the Accounts page already shows per-account rollups;
   the big dashboard still aggregates across accounts).
4. **Diagnostics per account**; desktop `main.py` account enumeration (polling is
   server-side, so lower priority).
5. **Version bump + CHANGELOG version entry + deploy** once the pilot is end-to-end.

**FurAffinity polling — FAExport upstream (resolved diagnosis, 2026-06-16):**
The owner (Deer-Spangle) replied on
[faexport#129](https://github.com/Deer-Spangle/faexport/issues/129): the public
`faexport.spangle.org.uk` instance is hitting a **persistent Cloudflare challenge
page** (now the standard managed-challenge interstitial, not a text error). He
**tried changing his VPS IP and still gets blocked**, and switched his own
services to a **locally-hosted FAExport** (which works); the public site is
best-effort and has been blocked unusually long. A community commenter
(bshahin101) mapped the Cloudflare codes: 1006/1007/1008 = IP-banned, 1015 =
rate-limited, managed challenge = needs a real browser/token — and noted a
managed challenge (which is what FA now serves) is **not** solvable by IP
rotation. **Implication for PawPoller:** the CF Worker proxy (IP rotation) will
NOT fix FA polling — it's a challenge, not just an IP block. The only viable
fixes are (a) **self-host FAExport** (the owner's own solution), or (b) the
**direct-FA-cookie polling** fallback (the posting path already talks to FA
directly via cookies). Owner may file an FA trouble ticket; no public-API ETA.

**Fallback (b) is now implemented.** `clients/fa/client.py` gained
`get_all_gallery_ids_direct` / `get_submission_details_batch_direct` /
`_parse_submission_html` — they scrape FA's gallery + submission pages directly
via the session cookies and return the same dict shape as the FAExport path. The
FA poller tries FAExport first and **auto-falls-back to direct on failure**; set
`fa_direct_polling=true` to skip FAExport entirely (recommended while it's
blocked). Comment/watcher/profile data is FAExport-only and skipped in direct
mode; the core views/faves/comments snapshot still works. **Run it from the
desktop instance** — FA's Cloudflare blocks the datacenter server IP. Parser
verified by `tests/test_fa_direct.py`. If FA HTML drifts, the regexes in
`_parse_submission_html` (stats/title/rating/tags) are the things to update.

**FA official policy + upcoming API (announced ~2026-06-22) — changes the plan.**
FA published a formal third-party / bot policy and announced an **official
read-only API** (invite-only closed beta; application form
https://forms.gle/8XNUo61fK4VyQdHA6 ; FA+ members can join via Discord). Net
effect for PawPoller:
- **The official read-only API is the proper long-term replacement** for BOTH
  FAExport and the direct-cookie scrape. Apply to the closed beta. Read-only is
  exactly what polling needs (views/faves/comments); writes (posting) come later.
- **Legitimise the current scraping NOW:** FA asks M2M scraping/verification
  services to file a **Trouble Ticket → Tech → "Access Requests"** so they can
  identify the traffic pattern and *retain* access; they also said they'll reach
  out to people whose scripts broke on CF blocks who filed tickets. File one for
  the desktop direct-polling traffic.
- **Stated technical rules:** ≤1 request/second (we're at 1.5s ✅), proper
  **exponential backoff** (direct path has NONE ⚠️), stand down during CF DDoS
  mitigation, and keep activity to periods with <15k users online. The direct
  path needs exponential backoff + explicit Cloudflare-challenge detection (a
  challenge page is HTTP 200 and silently parses to all-zero stats — the
  2.27.1 zero-snapshot guard now stops it corrupting data, but a real backoff is
  still the policy-compliant fix). Postybirb/FABUI are explicitly permitted; an
  app like PawPoller is the "third-party software" the access-request path covers.

**SoFurry "beta" rewrite (broke ~2026-06-13) — React Router SPA.**
SoFurry replaced the whole site with a React Router (Remix-style) SPA. What this
broke and where it stands:
- **Polling — FIXED ([2.27.2]).** Old gallery scrape + `/ui/submission/{id}` JSON
  API (now 404) + `/s/{id}` "N Views" text are all gone. New source: React Router
  loader data at `…​.data` URLs (turbo-stream). `/s/{id}.data` carries
  views/likes/comments/title **login-free** for published works. The poller now
  polls DB-known IDs (∪ discovery) via `/s/{id}.data`, so the time-series resumed
  without a working login. Parser = `_rr_int`/`_rr_str` in `clients/sf/client.py`,
  verified live against 5 works.
- **New-work discovery — degraded.** `/u/{handle}/gallery.data` is SFW-filtered
  when unauthenticated, so adult galleries return no items. Auto-discovery of NEW
  works needs a rebuilt authenticated session. Existing works keep polling fine.
- **Posting — STILL BROKEN, needs a dedicated rebuild.** Three things to redo:
  (1) **login** — the CF-Worker `x-proxy-login` flow is stale vs the new site (new
  login page still has a Laravel `_token` + `<meta csrf-token>`, so direct login
  may still work from a residential IP; the Worker's hardcoded login logic likely
  needs updating — Worker source is deployed on Cloudflare, not in this repo);
  (2) **create/edit API** — `create_submission`/`edit_submission` POST to the
  `/ui/submission` endpoints, which now 404. Reverse-engineer the new React Router
  action routes (likely `.data` POSTs with the `csrfToken` from the loader data);
  (3) **content format** — the editor is now TipTap/ProseMirror. Target HTML
  reference: `docs/reference/sofurry_beta_tiptap_sample.html`. The SF converter
  (`editor/converter.py` `_convert_body_sofurry`) currently emits
  `class="text-center"`/`"text-right"` alignment + `<p><strong>` pseudo-headings;
  the new renderer wants inline `style="text-align:…"` and real `<h1>/<h2>/<h3>`.
  Can't verify a render until login+create are working, so sequence: login →
  create/edit endpoints → converter, then post a test work and eyeball it.

**Riskiest watch-items:** any poster still reading `session_cache WHERE id=1` (silent
shared token); reintroducing the write-lock-across-await bug in pollers; account-manifest
sync surrogate stability; backfill landing on the right per-platform default account.

---

**Per-version history lives in `../CHANGELOG.md`** — every release has a full prose entry
there. Grep it by version (`## [2.26.1]`) instead of reading it whole. This file carries
only current state.

**Deployed to:** GCP instance `pawpoller` (zone `us-east1-c`), running 2.26.3 — in sync
with master.

**Ops notes (2026-06-10):**
- **Billing-lapse outage:** GCP billing lapsed in early June; Google TERMINATED the VM
  (polling down for up to ~2 weeks). Billing re-enabled + VM restarted 2026-06-10;
  container came back healthy on its restart policy. The ephemeral external IP changed:
  35.243.213.49 → **35.231.162.181** — anything pointing at the old IP (bookmarks,
  desktop pairing `posting_server_url`) needs updating. Consider a reserved static IP.
- **FAExport outage (FA polling dead since ~2026-05-26):** every JSON endpoint on
  faexport.spangle.org.uk 500s with `error_type: unknown_http` (web UI fine, all users,
  all client IPs — their scraper session against FA is broken, most likely a Cloudflare
  block of their egress IP in a page format their detection misses). Reported upstream
  with code-level diagnosis as
  [Deer-Spangle/faexport#129](https://github.com/Deer-Spangle/faexport/issues/129) —
  check there before re-investigating FA poll errors. Long-term fallback if it stays
  dead: direct-FA polling via cookie auth (the posting path already talks to FA directly).

**GitHub master:** https://github.com/knaughtykat01-prog/PawPoller — push-to-master
triggers no auto-deploy; ship with `/pp-deploy` (or `deploy/pawcli.bat`).

Living document — update as state shifts. Read this first when picking up a session.

## What PawPoller is

Multi-platform story publishing + polling pipeline for furry fiction. Runs two ways:

- **Desktop** (Windows exe / Linux AppImage): `main.py` → PyInstaller → pywebview +
  pystray. Needed for FA posting (datacenter IP blocks) and Edge-fallback PDF rendering.
- **Headless** (GCP/Docker): `server.py`. Polls 11 platforms, serves dashboard + editor,
  posts to everything except FA (auto-queued to desktop).

Port 8420. Story archive at `/app/story-archive` on server,
`../m_x/Archives/Complete_Stories/` locally.

## Where we are

**Public beta ready.** Everything on `ROADMAP_PUBLIC.md` through the must/should-haves is
shipped: setup wizard, embedded browser login, credential vault, story wizard,
multi-format editor with anchor toolbar, selective regeneration, publish-check matrix
with scheduling + retry queue + drift detection + draft probes, per-platform
tags/descriptions, cover/chapter thumbnails, EPUB output + in-app viewer, mobile mode,
8-theme picker, diagnostics tab (~170 tests), CLI TUI, Windows installer (Inno), Linux
AppImage, auto-updater, in-app uninstall. The feature-by-feature record is in CHANGELOG.

### Genuinely open work

- **Weasyl posting test** — blocked on account-level verification, not code.
- **Draft probes for Bsky / Wattpad / DA / Itaku / Weasyl** — confirm per-platform
  whether a draft state even exists before adding probes (FA/IB/SF/AO3/SqW are done).
- **AO3 import end-to-end verification** — code path identical to SqW (which works);
  test was blocked by AO3's throttle. Run imports from desktop (residential IP).
- **Bundled fonts in EPUB** — deferred until an EPUB appearance panel exists.
- **macOS desktop build** — same per-OS shim shape as Linux (2.25.0) plus .app/.dmg
  packaging; Apple Developer cert / notarization decision open.
- **Marketing site version refresh** — Hero version chip + GetIt CTA label are still a
  manual edit after each release (CF Pages auto-deploys on push to `site/**`).

---

## Deploy cheat sheet

```bash
# Code changes (or just use /pp-deploy)
cd C:/Users/rhysc/claude/PawPoller
git add <files> && git commit -m "..." && git push
gcloud compute ssh pawpoller --zone=us-east1-c --command="cd /home/kithetiger/PawPoller && sudo -u kithetiger git pull && sudo docker compose up -d --build"

# Story archive: local -> server / server -> local
deploy/pawpush.bat            # alias: pawsync.bat; supports --prune / --dry-run / --force
deploy/pawpull.bat [Story]    # full sync or single story

# Verify
gcloud compute ssh pawpoller --zone=us-east1-c --command="curl -s http://localhost:8420/api/health"
gcloud compute ssh pawpoller --zone=us-east1-c --command="sudo docker compose -f /home/kithetiger/PawPoller/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=30 pawpoller"
```

Pause/resume polling: `POST /api/poll/pause` / `/resume` with `Authorization: Bearer pp_…`
(key in server settings.json).

---

## Known gotchas (don't get caught again)

1. **Tag DB location**: `/app/data/` is a Docker volume — it SHADOWS bundled files.
   That's why `tag_database/` lives at PawPoller root.
2. **story.json `index` not `number`** in `chapter_info[]` entries.
3. **Default tag cascade**: `default` tags cascade to every poster in `_parse_story_json()`.
4. **SQW is per-chapter only** — full-story SQW cell shows `not_supported`.
5. **FA posting requires desktop** — server posts auto-queue for desktop pickup.
6. **pawsync must precede code push** referencing new story files; it pre-checks server
   freshness and aborts if the server copy is newer (then: pawpull first, or `--force`).
7. **Server perm on archive**: container runs uid 1001, archive owned by kithetiger
   (1000); pawsync does `chmod o+rwX`.
8. **WeasyPrint on Windows**: missing GTK → automatic Edge headless fallback.
9. **confirm_live guard**: backend rejects post/update without `confirm_live=true`.
10. **Never hold a SQLite write transaction across an await** in pollers — commit before
    any network fetch that follows a write (2.26.3; busy_timeout is 30s and AO3's 12s
    pacing held the lock for minutes).
11. **AO3 routes direct from GCP** (`PROXY_OPTIONAL_PLATFORMS`) — the shared CF Worker
    egress pool burns AO3's per-IP quota (2.22.11). CF proxy is for DA + SF only.

## Claude Code automation

Two skills + two subagents live under `~/.claude/` (global, not in this repo):

| Ask | Use |
|---|---|
| "cut v2.27.0" / "release" | `/pp-release 2.27.0 "blurb"` — verifies (both subagents in parallel), commits, tags, pushes, watches CI, confirms 3 release assets |
| "deploy to prod" / "pawupdate" | `/pp-deploy [version]` — sync-check, confirm, SSH rebuild, health + log verification |
| "is the release ready to tag?" | `release-verifier` subagent (read-only: version/CHANGELOG/HANDOFF/AppId-GUID/tests/tree checks → SAFE TO TAG / DO NOT TAG) |
| "audit security of recent changes" | `security-reviewer` subagent (read-only, scoped to auth/credential/shell-out/path surface → SAFE / BLOCK) |

Both skills are `disable-model-invocation: true` — only the user typing them fires them.

## CI / release pipeline

`Build & Release` fires on `v*` tag pushes: `build-windows` (PyInstaller zip + Inno
installer), `build-linux` (ubuntu-22.04, AppImage), `test` (pytest, 91 green). `Lint`
(ruff + JS syntax) on every master push. Release uses `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`
(v2 broke 2026-05-26 — see CHANGELOG [2.26.2]). Known flake: asset upload can hit a
transient "Server Error"; `gh run rerun --failed` recovers it. Three assets per release:
windows zip, `PawPoller-Setup-*.exe`, `*-x86_64.AppImage`. Tags lag master by design —
last tag v2.26.x; cut releases deliberately, not per-commit.

Marketing site (https://pawpoller.pages.dev) auto-deploys via CF Pages on master pushes
touching `site/**`.

## QA

All QA artefacts under `qa/`:
- `qa/TESTING_CHECKLIST_WEBAPP.html` — ~566 rows, browser/Docker surface
  (localStorage `pawpoller_test_webapp`)
- `qa/TESTING_CHECKLIST_NATIVE.html` — ~638 rows, Windows/Linux desktop surface
  (localStorage `pawpoller_test_native`)
- `qa/fixtures/` — reproducible upload payloads (see its README)
- `qa/AUTOMATED_BUG_LOG.md` — Playwright sweep findings (all filed bugs through BUG-021
  fixed or retracted as of 2.16.14)

Sweep WEBAPP first (covers the Docker surface), NATIVE on a real Windows build for the
native-only sections. Python unit tests live in `tests/` — different surface.

## For the next session

1. This file.
2. `../CHANGELOG.md` top entry (and grep deeper history as needed).
3. `documentation_guide.md` for architecture depth (poller patterns, DB PRAGMAs + the
   write-lock rule, EPUB viewer, auto-sync, diagnostics).
4. `routes/editor_api.py` + `routes/settings_api.py` if touching the API surface.
