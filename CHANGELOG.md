## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Mobile-first UI overhaul** — comprehensive responsive redesign for phone and tablet use
- **Collapsible sidebar navigation** — platform sections collapse into accordion groups on mobile (<=768px), reducing 30+ links to manageable groups that expand on tap
- **Bottom navigation bar** — fixed bottom bar on mobile with quick access to Overview, Platforms (opens sidebar), Analytics, and Settings
- **Table-to-card transformation** — all 9 platform submission tables transform into stacked card layouts on mobile using `data-label` attributes for inline column headers
- **Safe area support** — `viewport-fit=cover` and `env(safe-area-inset-*)` CSS for notched devices (iPhone etc.)
- **Touch optimisation** — `touch-action: manipulation` on all interactive elements, `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`, 44px minimum touch targets
- **Responsive chart sizing** — chart heights reduce from 280px to 220px/200px at tablet/phone breakpoints
- **Mobile-friendly settings** — form inputs stack vertically with full-width fields and 44px min-height on mobile
- **Wider sidebar on mobile** — sidebar expands to 280px (up from 220px) when opened as overlay for easier tap targets
- **Date range buttons** — range buttons flex-fill and centre-align on mobile for even spacing

### Changed
- Sidebar overlay element moved from JS-created to HTML for better bottom-nav integration
- Stat cards use 10px gap on mobile (down from 16px) and single-column at 480px
- Pinned cards use smaller flex-basis (160px/140px) for better mobile scrolling
- Top list titles truncate at 55vw/60vw on mobile for consistent layout
- Comment cards reduce padding on mobile for space efficiency
- Growth rate values use smaller font (14px) at 480px

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-09

### Security
- **Zip Slip prevention** — auto-updater now validates all ZIP entry paths before extraction to prevent path traversal attacks
- **XSS fix** — `escapeHtml()` now escapes single quotes (`'` -> `&#39;`) preventing attribute injection via submission titles
- **Timing attack fix** — HTTP Basic Auth now evaluates both username and password in constant time (no short-circuit)
- **Error response hardening** — global exception handler no longer leaks internal error details to clients

### Fixed
- **SqW Anubis solver** — proof-of-work implementation now correctly finds a nonce with leading zeros matching difficulty, instead of computing a single hash (which always failed)
- **WP/IK detail charts broken** — `Charts.submissionLine()` now accepts a custom metrics array; Wattpad charts correctly plot reads/votes/lists and Itaku charts plot likes/reshares
- **WP/IK missing from 5 UI components** — added Wattpad and Itaku entries to `overviewTopList`, `overviewRecentActivity`, `trendingCards`, `linkCards`, and `linkSuggestions` badge/route maps; items no longer misidentified as Inkbunny
- **Poll error logs lost** — all 9 pollers now `conn.commit()` after writing error status to poll_log; failed cycles are no longer silently rolled back
- **IB web session lock-in** — CSRF token failure no longer permanently locks the web client in a failed state; session now properly detects expiry and re-authenticates
- **IB comment truncation** — added double-quote fallback for BBCode extraction regex; comments containing apostrophes are no longer silently truncated
- **5 batch methods crash on single failure** — SqW, AO3, WP, IK, and DA `get_*_details_batch()` methods now catch per-item exceptions instead of crashing the entire batch
- **Server startup fallthrough** — main.py now exits with error code if the server fails to start within 15 seconds, instead of opening a blank native window
- **Poll interval zero spin** — poll intervals are now clamped to minimum 1 minute, preventing infinite CPU spin or crashes from zero/negative/non-numeric values
- **Telegram /notify comments** — command now toggles comment-specific setting instead of the IB master notification switch
- **Telegram /notify missing platforms** — added sqw, ao3, da, wp, ik to the notification toggle map
- **DB restore corruption** — backup restore now removes stale WAL/SHM journal files to prevent replaying old transactions against the restored database
- **SF schema incomplete** — added missing `new_watchers_found` column to `sf_poll_log` table definition
- **Update temp cleanup** — failed update downloads now clean up their temp directory instead of leaving orphaned files

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-09

### Security
- **Dashboard authentication** — optional HTTP Basic Auth for server/Docker deployments (set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` env var)
- **Update endpoint hardened** — `/api/update/apply` now restricted to GitHub URLs only (prevents SSRF)
- **SQL injection fix** — parameterized weeks value in historical analytics query
- **Thumbnail proxy domain whitelist** — fixed substring matching bypass on IB and FA proxies (e.g. `evil-metapix.net` no longer passes)
- **Thread-safe credentials** — added mutex lock protecting credential reads/writes between web and poller threads

### Fixed
- **Poller deadlock** — all 9 pollers could permanently lock up if database connection failed at startup; restructured try/finally to guarantee lock release
- **WP/IK column name crashes** — milestones, digest, goals, and analytics now use platform-aware column mapping (Wattpad: reads/votes, Itaku: likes/reshares)
- **10 database connection leaks** — all `auth_status` endpoints now close connections in `finally` blocks
- **HTML injection in Telegram** — all titles and usernames are now HTML-escaped in notification messages across all 9 pollers
- **Poll log not committed** — "no submissions found" cycles now persist their poll log entries
- **WS/DA/WP/IK missing notifications** — notification functions were defined but never called; now wired into poll cycles
- **Telegram bot incomplete** — `/stats`, `/top`, `/poll`, `/status`, `/interval` commands now support all 9 platforms
- **table_map incomplete** — pins, goals, tags, historical analytics, groups, and links now include all 9 platforms
- **AO3 work discovery** — narrowed regex to only match works in the listing section, not sidebar/related works
- **DA cookie validation** — now checks for authenticated indicators instead of generic page words
- **IB login check** — removed overly permissive `status_code == 200` fallback
- **IB rating unlock** — response now checked for errors (prevents silent adult content filtering)
- **AO3 login detection** — changed fragile "greeting" text match to `class="greeting"` attribute check
- **SF empty CSRF** — login now fails early with clear error instead of proceeding with empty token
- **SF poll log** — `new_watchers_found` was accepted but silently dropped from SQL UPDATE
- **Rate limit constants** — AO3/DA/WP/IK/SqW clients now use config.py values instead of hardcoded local copies
- **SqW dead code** — removed unused `guest_match` variable
- **IK unused import** — removed `from urllib.parse import urlencode`
- **Frontend: compare chip IDs** — SF/SqW/AO3 now use `parseInt()` matching other platforms
- **Frontend: overview activity** — recent activity timeline now merges all 9 platforms
- **Frontend: groups dropdown** — all 9 platforms available for adding group members
- **Frontend: metric labels** — pinned submissions, growth rates, and analytics use correct platform-specific labels (reads/votes for WP, likes for IK)
- **Frontend: poll interval settings** — added UI controls for SqW/AO3/DA/WP/IK
- **Frontend: interval stacking** — auto-refresh and poll progress intervals now cleared before recreation

### Added
- **FA watcher spam protection** — 3-layer system: keyword filter, confirmation delay (must survive 2 poll cycles), profile sniff (zero-activity detection)
- **FA watcher digest mode** — `fa_watcher_notification_mode` setting: immediate, daily, or off
- **Pagination safety limits** — all client pagination loops capped at 1000 pages to prevent infinite loops
- **Async context managers** — all 9 client classes support `async with` for safe resource cleanup
- **Transport-level retries** — all HTTP clients retry on connection errors (2 retries via httpx transport)
- **Client shutdown cleanup** — atexit handlers close persistent HTTP clients on app termination
- Bullet character consistency — SF/SqW/AO3 Telegram messages now use `•` matching other platforms
